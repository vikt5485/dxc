          <h2>Business Central vs. Dynamics NAV</h2>
          <h3>Standard functionality</h3>

          <p>
            Just like Microsoft Dynamics NAV, Business Central functionality is divided across two packs. <br />
            Essentials maps 1:1 to the functionality provided in the Dynamics NAV Starter Pack, and Premium maps to the Dynamics NAV Extended Pack.<br />
            The table below shows the high-levelfunctional areas that are addressed by both solutions.

    <h2>Key areas of comparison</h2>
    <h2>Enhancing the solutions</h2>
<li>Business Central can be enhanced only with
    “apps” purchased through Microsoft AppSource.
    <br>There is no custom development.<br> All apps are
    approved and published by Microsoft. It is possible
    to customize Business Central through tenant- or
    customer-specific extensions created and uploaded
    to the tenant by partners.</li><br>
    <li>Dynamics NAV can be enhanced through
        “extensions” purchased through the partner
        channel (pre-built enhancements that are approved
        by Microsoft) and through custom development.
        Customers can also skill-up and manage their
        own development.<br><br>
        Features for menu design, creating reports, etc. are
        included as standard in both solutions.</li>
    
        <h2>Hosting options</h2>
        <li>Business Central is hosted by Microsoft on Azure
            in a public cloud.</li><br>
<li>Dynamics NAV can be deployed on Azure, in a
    private data center or on premises.</li>
    <h2>Licensing</h2>
    <li>Business Central uses subscription licensing that
        includes the application, hosting and maintenance
        in one per-user monthly fee.</li><br>
    <li>Dynamics NAV is available with perpetual or
        subscription-based licensing for the application (for
        subscription, the monthly fee includes maintenance);
        hosting is an additional cost.</li>
        <h2>Accessing the solutions</h2>
        <li>Business Central is accessed through a web client
            (a browser) and mobile apps for smart phones and
            tablets.</li>
        <li>Dynamics NAV is accessed through a PC client
            (the Windows client), web and mobile app.</li>
            <p>Both solutions also offer access directly from Outlook.</p>
   </ul>

 
   <ul>
    <h2>Which is the right solution for you?</h2>
    <p>Both solutions are aimed at the mid-size market.
    Business Central is priced to be attractive to larger
    SMBs and smaller organizations as they outgrow their
    entry-level accounting solutions and look for their first
    ERP solution</p>
       <li>Business Central is aimed primarily at new users
        whose needs are well met by standard software. As
        the AppSource offerings mature and increase, more
        complex users will see this solution as a viable option.
       </li>
       <li>Dynamics NAV is aimed at users with complex
        needs (where enhancements are required) and for
        those who require an on-premises solution.</li>
